# Review comments by Sang

We are going to use this as a basis for
weekly 1-1.

## April 13 (Thursday)
- .gitignore is missing
- "employee-app"
  - part #1 is done
  - part #2 and after are missing

## April 17 (Monday morning)
- "employee_app" done until part #5
- Usage of enhanced for-loop in the Department
  class would have been nicer since we are
  now using ArrayList 
- "sba_exercise" has some package compiler error
