# Review comments by Sang

We are going to use this as a basis for
weekly 1-1.

## April 13 (Thursday)
- .gitignore is missing
- "employee-app"
  - part #1 is done
  - part #2 and after are missing

## April 17 (Monday morning)
- "employee_app" done until part #5
- Usage of enhanced for-loop in the Department
  class would have been nicer since we are
  now using ArrayList 
- "sba_exercise" has some package compiler error

## April 18 (Tuesday morning)
- "sba_exercise" has some compiler error due to
  an issue on a MySystem constructor
    
  
## April 24th

- "SBA_Core_Java/Exercise1" 
  - convertStringArrayIntoArrayList(..) should have returned ArrayList object
  - createANewArrayListFromExistingArray(..) method implemented incorrectly
  - main method does not call these methods for testings

- "SBA_Core_Java/Exercise2"
  - It is done correctly
  
- You have a compiler error in "SBA_Exercises/MySystem" class
